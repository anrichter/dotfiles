My personal DotFiles
====================

My dotfiles are for bash and PowerShell environments.
To install it in a bash environment simple start

    ./install.sh

If you like the PowerShell you can install the dofiles there with

    .\install.ps1

In order to run this script you have to set the ExecutionPolicy as an Administrator like this

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
